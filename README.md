# top10_battleship

Battleship project from the Odin Project, here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship

1. WebGL 3d canvas

2. Locked canvas to CSS grid, even in 3d transformed space

3. Game loop

4. Animations

5. Javascript promises for asynchronous 3d model loading

6. Good separation of modules and functions. References to objects and functions are passed between modules allowing them to perform actions

7. Heavy use of algorithms, eg, find set of coordinates given a starting point, direction, and shipsize, attack algorithm that searches around a hit in order to find the rest of the ship,
